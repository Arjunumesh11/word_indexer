FNMATCH(3)                Linux Programmer's Manual               FNMATCH(3)

NAME         top

       fnmatch - match filename or pathname

SYNOPSIS         top

       #include <fnmatch.h>

       int fnmatch(const char *pattern, const char *string, int flags);

DESCRIPTION         top

       The fnmatch() function checks whether the string argument matches the
       pattern argument, which is a shell wildcard pattern (see glob(7)).

       The flags argument modifies the behavior; it is the bitwise OR of
       zero or more of the following flags:

       FNM_NOESCAPE
              If this flag is set, treat backslash as an ordinary character,
              instead of an escape character.

       FNM_PATHNAME
              If this flag is set, match a slash in string only with a slash
              in pattern and not by an asterisk (*) or a question mark (?)
              metacharacter, nor by a bracket expression ([]) containing a
              slash.

       FNM_PERIOD
              If this flag is set, a leading period in string has to be
              matched exactly by a period in pattern.  A period is
              considered to be leading if it is the first character in
              string, or if both FNM_PATHNAME is set and the period
              immediately follows a slash.

       FNM_FILE_NAME
              This is a GNU synonym for FNM_PATHNAME.

       FNM_LEADING_DIR
              If this flag (a GNU extension) is set, the pattern is
              considered to be matched if it matches an initial segment of
              string which is followed by a slash.  This flag is mainly for
              the internal use of glibc and is implemented only in certain
              cases.

       FNM_CASEFOLD
              If this flag (a GNU extension) is set, the pattern is matched
              case-insensitively.

       FNM_EXTMATCH
              If this flag (a GNU extension) is set, extended patterns are
              supported, as introduced by 'ksh' and now supported by other
              shells.  The extended format is as follows, with pattern-list
              being a '|' separated list of patterns.

       '?(pattern-list)'
              The pattern matches if zero or one occurrences of any of the
              patterns in the pattern-list match the input string.

       '*(pattern-list)'
              The pattern matches if zero or more occurrences of any of the
              patterns in the pattern-list match the input string.

       '+(pattern-list)'
              The pattern matches if one or more occurrences of any of the
              patterns in the pattern-list match the input string.

       '@(pattern-list)'
              The pattern matches if exactly one occurrence of any of the
              patterns in the pattern-list match the input string.

       '!(pattern-list)'
              The pattern matches if the input string cannot be matched with
              any of the patterns in the pattern-list.

RETURN VALUE         top

       Zero if string matches pattern, FNM_NOMATCH if there is no match or
       another nonzero value if there is an error.

CONFORMING TO         top

       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, POSIX.2.  The FNM_FILE_NAME,
       FNM_LEADING_DIR, and FNM_CASEFOLD flags are GNU extensions.
